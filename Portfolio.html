                        Heyüëãüèª! My name is Benny. I'm currently a sophomore at the University of California,
                        Berkeley pursuing a BA in Computer Science. I have a deep curiosity for AI and 
                        a profound interest in Development Operations. In my free time, I enjoy coding 
                        Front-End projects and adding functionality to their design. I aspire to be a part 
                        of the Tech Community and contribute to the thousands of meaningful inventions that 
                        have led us to a technologically advanced future. Apart from coding, I enjoy 
                        binging TV Shows, playing basketball, and being a proud Gymrat.

                        learning how to program. Throughout my student journey, I've worked with several 
                        programming languages and have been a part of many hands-on learning opportunities 
                        that have developed my problem-solving abilities, creativity, and programming fundamentals.

                        used media queries to make it scalable for devices with a width of 390px or more.

                        of the well-known basketball team, the Golden State Warriors. I used html and 
                        css for design, incorporating javascript for functionality. It's a simple two 
                        player game where one player chooses a box and answers a question and earns
                        points based off how much the question is worth.  <br><br>

                        lets me create memberships, check a member's status such as if its expired or still valid, and 
                        track total profits. <br><br>
